Bummed by the demise of TVShows? I just hacked together a supremely quick-n-dirty replacement.

1. Collect underpants
2. Take a look at db/database.json and add/remove shows as appropriate
3. Alternatively, use TVShows::Database to manually add some shows, eg:

  require 'lib/tvshows/datavase'

  TVShows::Database.open do |shows|
    shows.clear
    shows.add(TVShows::Show.new("Banana Man"))
    shows.add(TVShows::Show.new("The Goodies", TVShows::Episode.new(1, 1)))
  end

4. Periodically run lib/tvshows.rb to download torrents to your ~/Downloads folder
5. Profit
