Bummed by the demise of TVShows? I just hacked together a supremely quick-n-dirty replacement.

1. Collect underpants
2. Take a look at database.json and add/remove tv shows as appropriate
3. Alternatively, load up the TVShows::Database class and manually add some shows
4. Periodically run lib/tvshows.rb to download torrents to your ~/Downloads folder
5. Profit
